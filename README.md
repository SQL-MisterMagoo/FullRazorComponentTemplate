# FullRazorComponentTemplate

Sample Item template for VS2022 showing how to include multiple files.

To test, you can simply download the files to a folder called `FullRazorComponent` (name is not important) in  `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\Templates\ItemTemplates`

You can then customise the `.razor, .cs, .css, .ico` to suit - and if you want, you can edit the `vstemplate` to change the name/description
